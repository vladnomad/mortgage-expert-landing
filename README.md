# Mortgage expert landing

A landing page template for a mortgage expert in a consulting company. Designed to be used for multiple experts, fetching data from a JSON database. Finally, the project was split into separate static pages, leaving database fetching for ease of text content change for the client. 
Client asked for a contact form fuctionality, Google Map, statistics and reviews sections. Header and contact form on large screens were designed to stick while scrolling through main content, stopping on the map/reviews section, which acts as a footer. Light and minimalistic design was used with company accent colors.
